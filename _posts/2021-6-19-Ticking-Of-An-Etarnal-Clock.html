<h1>Burning Of An Eternal Clock</h1>
<div class="author"> Sakib Ahamed Shahon </div>
<pre><div class="poetry_body">
Moments pass ,
Ticking of an eternal clock,
We live , feel & die within it's tick-tock.

Sparks of life races the clock,
Bursts so bright , dancing and strong,
Tell me sparks , why burn so bright?
Only to fade in an eternal night?

"To leave my ashes of wisdom behind,
For more sparks to burn,
Brighter than I "
