## Welcome to My Blog

The Blog is built and run on jekyll , since I am building it from scratch there is a lot space for improvement. If you encounter any bugs feel free put up an issue. 
The blog currently includes very basic features , and very few writings. 

If you want to suggest any changes to the layout or think some feature you can simply add an issue and I will try my best to add them .

You can use this repo for building your own blog too , simply fork it and remove all files from _posts_ folder and add your own files there in either 
markdown or html format. Since any guide or doc isn't up yet you can simply contact me if you are having trouble navigating the code.
